# Release Policy

## Purpose

This repository publishes a NuGet package. This policy defines when to create Git tags, GitHub Releases, and NuGet packages, and how to keep them consistent.

## Policy Summary

- Every stable NuGet package publish should have:
  - a matching Git tag
  - a matching GitHub Release
  - release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`
- Preview NuGet packages may have a GitHub prerelease when the preview is intended for external users and needs release notes or visibility.
- Nightly, CI, internal, or temporary validation packages should normally not have a GitHub Release.

## Versioning

Use Semantic Versioning.

Examples:

- Stable: `1.2.3`
- Preview: `1.3.0-preview.1`
- Release candidate: `1.3.0-rc.1`
- Alpha (untagged build): `1.3.0-alpha.0.4`

Tag format:

- Stable: `v1.2.3`
- Preview: `v1.3.0-preview.1`
- RC: `v1.3.0-rc.1`

Alpha versions are **not tagged**. They are produced automatically by MinVer from the commit height since the last tag. Do not create tags of the form `v1.3.0-alpha.0.4`.

The Git tag, GitHub Release, and NuGet package version should represent the same shipped version. This applies to stable and preview releases only — alpha builds are not shipped releases.

## Stable Releases

Create a GitHub Release for every stable package published to NuGet.

This is the default release path because stable versions are human-facing milestones and should have:

- a discoverable release page
- release notes for consumers
- a clear changelog history
- a stable tag tied to the shipped code

Minimum requirements for a stable release:

1. The version is finalized.
2. The package has been built from the tagged commit.
3. The tag matches the package version.
4. A GitHub Release is published for the tag.
5. `CHANGELOG.md` has a reviewed `[X.Y.Z]` section, which becomes the release notes.

## Preview Releases

Preview packages do not always require a GitHub Release.

Create a GitHub prerelease when:

- the preview is announced to users outside the core team
- consumers need notes about changes, migration steps, or known limitations
- the preview is part of a planned validation cycle

Do not create a GitHub Release when:

- the package is only for CI validation
- the package is internal or temporary
- the build is a disposable test artifact

When a preview release is created:

- use a prerelease package version such as `1.4.0-preview.2`
- create a matching tag such as `v1.4.0-preview.2`
- publish a GitHub Release marked as prerelease
- do not mark it as latest

## Alpha, Nightly, and CI Packages

Untagged commits on `main` automatically produce alpha versions such as `1.3.0-alpha.0.4` via MinVer. These are not published to NuGet.org and do not get a GitHub Release.

These packages are not part of the public release history.

## Source of Truth

The shipped source for a released package must be recoverable from Git.

That means:

- every public stable release must have a tag
- the package should be built from the tagged commit or a reproducible equivalent
- the release page should reference the same version as the package

## Release Notes Policy

`CHANGELOG.md` is the source of truth for release notes. It follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/):

- Add user-visible changes to the `## [Unreleased]` section as they are merged, under `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed` or `Security`.
- Leave out changes users can't see, such as CI, tests and internal build work.
- Mark breaking changes with **Breaking:** and say how to update.
- When releasing, rename `[Unreleased]` to `[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, add a new empty `[Unreleased]` section and update the compare links at the bottom.
- Use that version's section as the GitHub Release notes.

The release checks the CHANGELOG before it builds anything, and stops when it isn't ready for the tag:

- A stable tag `vX.Y.Z` needs a `[X.Y.Z]` section that is the newest version in the file and isn't empty, and `[Unreleased]` must be empty. Entries left in `[Unreleased]` are part of the tagged commit but would be missing from the notes.
- A prerelease tag `vX.Y.Z-preview.N` with its own `[X.Y.Z-preview.N]` section follows the same rules.
- A prerelease tag without its own section uses the `[Unreleased]` section, which must not be empty, since a preview ships the changes gathered there so far. The tag must be newer than the newest version in the file, so a preview of an already released version is rejected.
- A stable tag also needs the README's install snippets (`#module …&version=X.Y.Z` and `#:package Cake.Download.Module@X.Y.Z`) to name `X.Y.Z`, because the README ships in the package as its nuget.org page. Prerelease tags skip this check, so during a preview the README can install either the preview or the latest stable version. Point it at the preview when it documents features only the preview has.

Release notes should describe user-visible change, not list commits or pull requests.

### Tag Rules

- Use the prefix `v` for every release tag.
- Do not alternate between formats such as `1.2.3` and `v1.2.3`.
- Do not reuse tags.

## Recommended Workflow

### Stable

1. Finalize version.
2. Merge release-ready changes.
3. In `CHANGELOG.md`, rename `[Unreleased]` to `[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, add a new empty `[Unreleased]` section and update the compare links. In `README.md`, update the install snippets to `X.Y.Z` and the supported Cake versions if they changed. Merge that change.
4. Run `./release.ps1 X.Y.Z` (or `-Bump`/`-Promote`) on that commit. It creates and pushes the tag; the Release workflow builds, publishes the package and creates the GitHub Release with the CHANGELOG section as notes.

### Preview

1. Choose preview version such as `X.Y.Z-preview.N`.
2. Check that `[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` describes the preview (or add a `[X.Y.Z-preview.N]` section).
3. Run `./release.ps1 -Bump Minor -Prerelease preview` (or `-Prerelease preview` for the next preview in a series). It creates and pushes the tag; the Release workflow publishes the package and a GitHub prerelease.

## Decision Rules

Use this quick rule set:

- Stable package published publicly: create GitHub Release.
- Preview package published publicly and meant for evaluation: usually create GitHub prerelease.
- Preview package for internal testing only: no GitHub Release.
- Nightly or CI package: no GitHub Release.

## Exceptions

It is acceptable to skip a GitHub Release for a stable package only in unusual cases, such as:

- emergency operational republish with no code change
- private package feed with no human release audience
- migration period while formal release process is being introduced

If an exception is used, document the reason in the repository or deployment log.

## Ownership

The maintainer publishing the package is responsible for ensuring:

- version correctness
- tag correctness
- release note quality
- prerelease versus stable classification

## Default Rule For This Repository

Unless explicitly decided otherwise:

- every public stable NuGet package gets a GitHub Release
- every externally shared preview package gets a GitHub prerelease
- internal, CI, and temporary packages do not get GitHub Releases

## Automation In This Repository

- Pull requests and pushes to `main` run `build --target All` (build, test, pack) and the runner tests on Cake 6.0.0 and 6.* on Windows, Linux and macOS.
- The tag push is the review point: there is no manual step between pushing a `v*` tag and the package appearing on nuget.org with a GitHub (pre)release, so review the changes and the notes before tagging. A preview that should not get a GitHub Release (internal or CI-only) must not be tagged.
- Create and push the tag with `./release.ps1` (PowerShell 7.2+, `git`, `gh` and the .NET SDK), e.g. `./release.ps1 -Bump Minor`, `./release.ps1 -Bump Minor -Prerelease preview` or `./release.ps1 -Promote`. Run it without arguments to see the latest release and suggested next versions; it changes nothing. With a version it checks the branch, working tree, CI status, tag uniqueness and the CHANGELOG gate (see Release Notes Policy), shows a summary and asks before tagging, then follows the Release workflow. Use `-WhatIf` for a dry run. Its version logic in `build/Release.psm1` is tested with Pester 5+: `Invoke-Pester ./test/Release.Tests.ps1`.
- Pushing a tag `vX.Y.Z` (or `vX.Y.Z-preview.N`) runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`: `Release-Notes` checks that `CHANGELOG.md` has notes for the tag (and, for a stable tag, that the README installs that version), then the same `All` build and runner tests run, all in a job without write permissions, then — in a separate `publish` job that only receives the built package — the `Release` target, which runs three steps in this order:
  1. `Draft-Release` creates the GitHub Release as a **draft** (CHANGELOG notes, package attached; invisible to users). It refuses if there is no package whose version equals the tag.
  2. `Publish` pushes `artifacts/Cake.Download.Module.X.Y.Z.nupkg` to nuget.org — the only irreversible step.
  3. `Release` publishes the draft (stable tags become latest; tags containing `-` become prereleases that are not latest).
- If the release job fails, re-run it ("Re-run failed jobs"): every step is safe to repeat. An existing draft is reused and gets its package replaced, NuGet skips a version that is already there, and an already published Release is left alone. If the failure happened before `Publish`, you can instead delete the draft and the tag (`gh release delete vX.Y.Z --cleanup-tag`) and release again.

## Publishing Setup (one-time, repository owner)

1. Create the GitHub environment `Production` in `mgnslndh/Cake.Download.Module`.
2. Add the secret `NUGET_USER` (the nuget.org account name) to that environment.
3. On nuget.org, add a Trusted Publishing policy for `Cake.Download.Module`: owner `mgnslndh`, repository `Cake.Download.Module`, workflow file `release.yml`, environment `Production`.
